```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_reffiliate/factories'
```

## ToDo
+ Add missing documentation
+ Add 2-2-stable and 2-1-stable support (or at least test them)
+ Improve affiliates admin
+ Improve User and Orders listing at user admin
+ Add option or helper to show referral code to the user
